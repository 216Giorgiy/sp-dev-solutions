# Using the solutions

To build and start using these projects, you'll need to clone and build the projects.

Clone this repository by executing the following command in your console:

```
git clone https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-solutions.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository folder which should be the same as the repository name:

```
cd sp-dev-solutions
```

To access the solutions use the following command, where you replace `solution-folder-name` with the name of the solution you want to access.

```
cd solution-folder-name

```

Now run the following command to install the npm packages:

```
npm install
```

This will install the required npm packages and dependencies to build and run the client-side project.


Once the npm packages are installed, run the following command to preview your web parts in SharePoint Workbench:

```
gulp serve
```
