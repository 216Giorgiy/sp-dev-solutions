# SharePoint Patterns and Practices Community Solutions

Welcome to the SharePoint PnP Community Solutions repository!

This repository contains samples and templates you can use as foundations and patterns of solutions for your SharePoint sites.
  
## About

This repository contains solution samples that implement different user scenarios that you can use as part of your solutions and SharePoint sites.  These samples are intended to provide end-to-end solutions that contain all of the components you need to fulfill productivity needs of users and teams.  For developers, these are extended examples, and contain some modules and patterns you may find useful to re-use in your solutions.

We welcome your reported issues, pull requests, and new solution samples. Please use the Github issues list to submit your feature requests and issues, and please submit pull requests and bug fixes.  For new solutions, you will want to review the solutions standards criteria for inclusion.  For more information, see [Contribution Guidance](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Using the solutions

To build and start using these projects, you'll need to clone and build the projects.

Clone this repository by executing the following command in your console:

```
git clone https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-solutions.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository folder which should be the same as the repository name:

```
cd sp-dev-solutions
```

To access the solutions use the following command, where you replace `solution-folder-name` with the name of the solution you want to access.

```
cd solution-folder-name

```

Now run the following command to install the npm packages:

```
npm install
```

This will install the required npm packages and dependencies to build and run the client-side project.


Once the npm packages are installed, run the following command to preview your web parts in SharePoint Workbench:

```
gulp serve
```
